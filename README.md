Logistic Regression
In this project, our focus revolves around an advertising dataset that presents information regarding whether a specific internet user engaged with an advertisement on a company's website. Our primary aim is to construct a predictive model capable of determining whether a user will click on an ad, leveraging the various user attributes available in the dataset. Through the analysis of these attributes, our objective is to establish a model that can effectively predict the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad featured on the website.
